## Troubleshooting

### Recording Issues

**Issue**: Screen recording laggy
- **Solution**: Close other applications, use hardware acceleration

**Issue**: Audio out of sync
- **Solution**: Record audio separately, sync in post-production

**Issue**: Browser crashes during recording
- **Solution**: Use lighter browser (Chrome), close extensions

### Demo Issues

**Issue**: Upload fails during recording
- **Solution**: Pre-test, have backup receipt ready

**Issue**: Processing takes too long
- **Solution**: Use smaller image, or speed up in post-production

**Issue**: Results don't display correctly
- **Solution**: Test beforehand, use known-good receipt
